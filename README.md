In this project, I need to train and test dataset to distinguish between a meal and no meal data. This project is extension of what we did in project-I such as working on same set of CSV files. The meal data is to be extracted from InsulinData.csv. A column has to be searched for non-zero value. This time indicates the team of the meal as tm. Based on certain conditions we need to decide whether this data falls under meal or no-meal. The no meal data is extracted based on this condition that tm+2hrs where tm is the start of some meal. I need to obtain a 2hr stretch of no meal data.
This project also involved handling missing data and using techniques such as linear interpolation or polynomial regres- sion to fill up missing data. Linear interpolation is a form of interpolation, which involves the generation of new values based on an existing set of values [2].On the other hand, Polynomial regression is a form of Linear regression where only due to the Non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, we add some polynomial terms to linear regression to convert it into Polynomial regression [3]. The feature needs to be extracted from the meal time series that are discriminatory between meal and no meal classes.Once a feature matrix is extracted of size N * 24, where N is the total number of tests and 24 is the size of the CGM(continuous glucose monitor) time series. N is distribution of meal and no meal data.Some of the features extracted for both are listed below:
• First differential
• Second differential
• Power Second Max
• Power Third Max
• Standard Deviation
After extracting the above mentioned matrix for both meal and no meal data, we need to train our dataset using Random Forest Classifier and split the training and test data set in a ratio of 80:20. Random Forest is a widely-used machine learning algorithm developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler, which combines the output of multiple decision trees to reach a single result [4].
In order to ensure variability in the training process, a 5- fold cross-validation technique was employed. This approach guarantees that the model receives five distinct partitions of the training set during each iteration. The evaluation of the model was conducted using supervised measures, including Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F-1 score. The model was subsequently preserved using the pickle module and serial- ized for utilization in testing scenarios. The trained model is utilized to make predictions on the test dataset, where the resulting labels are recorded as binary values (0 or 1) representing the predicted classes. The numerical value of 0 represents the absence of meal data, whereas the numerical value of 1 represents the presence of meal data.
A. An explanation of the solution
The solution for this project is delineated as a sequential procedure and is enumerated as follows:
• The CSV files were read and just the necessary columns that align with the project requirements were utilized. A timestamp column was added to both dataframes, namely CGMData and InsulinData. The InsulinData was cleaned by replacing any NA or Null values with 0.
• In order to generate meal and no meal data, it is necessary to compile a comprehensive list of valid timestamp data and thereafter iterate over it. When extracting meal data, the provided time delta falls within a 30-minute offset before the meal time (tm) and a 120-minute offset after the tm.
• A distinct logic, as illustrated in the project description, was employed to extract a sequence of data pertaining to the absence of meals.The data pertaining to both meals and no meals was subjected to a cleaning process in order to eliminate any instances of missing values (NA).
• Several significant features were extracted from the dataset, including Power II Max, Power III Max, II differential, I differential, and Standard deviation.
• Class Label columns were added to each feature matrix, where the value 1 represents meal data and the value 0 represents no meal data.The dataset was divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20% proportion. Additionally, a 5-fold cross-validation technique was em- ployed to evaluate the accuracy, recall, precision, and F-1 score. The model was trained using the Random Forest classifier.
• The model was saved and subsequently loaded in order to generate predicted labels for the test data. The labels that have been predicted are recorded in the file named ”Result.csv”.
B. A description of the results
In the above Fig. 2, we could see metrics for classification technique used on the training data set.
• Accuracy score with cross validation ≃ 92%. • Precision score with cross validation ≃ 89%. • Recall score with cross validation ≃ 97%.
• F-1 score with cross validation ≃ 93
